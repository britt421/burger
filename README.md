# burger

What the project does:
This site let's a User specify a burger that they would like to eat. They can choose if they want the burger prepared for on-site consumption or if they want the burger wrapped, bagged, and ready to go for take-out.

Why the project is useful:
This application could be used by a restaurant that uses a website to let customers place an order. Instead of a 'Devour it!' button, it would probably be a 'remove' button, so that the User can add items to their order and remove items as necessary.

How users can get started with the project:
To get started a User would simply enter the type of burger they want and hit the 'Add Burger' button to add it to the list. The User can move the burgers between the two lists by clicking the buttons 'Devour it!' and 'Has been eaten.'
